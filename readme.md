My name is Joseph Bauman. I currently work as a Systems Engineer for Lockheed Martin and am pursing my Masters Degree in Software Engineering. After just completing my Intro to Software Design class, I am hoping that this course builds seemlessly off of what I learned there. Coming from a background of studying Mechanical Engineering in my Undergrad at Villanova, this course very much interests me because it is the first one that I can see the engineering aspect of working in the software industry. Prior to this it was mostly just individual programs or systems, and now I am looking forward to see how they all work together.
